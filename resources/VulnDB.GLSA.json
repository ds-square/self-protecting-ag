As this change would cause severe issues with some Gentoo\npackages that depend on OpenSSL, Gentoo still ships OpenSSL with SSLv2\nenabled at build-time. Note that this does not mean that you are still\nvulnerable to DROWN because the OpenSSL project has taken further\nprecautions and applications would need to explicitly request SSLv2. We\nare working on a migration path to phase out SSLv2 that ensures that no\nuser-facing issues occur. Please reference bug 576128 for further details\non how this decision was made.",

  "description": "On December 2nd at approximately 03:45 UTC, one of the servers that makes up\nthe rsync.gentoo.org rotation was compromised via a remote exploit. At this\npoint, we are still performing forensic analysis. However, the compromised\nsystem had both an IDS and a file integrity checker installed and we have a\nvery detailed forensic trail of what happened once the box was breached, so\nwe are reasonably confident that the portage tree stored on that box was\nunaffected.The attacker appears to have installed a rootkit and modified/deleted some\nfiles to cover their tracks, but left the server otherwise untouched. The\nbox was in a compromised state for approximately one hour before it was\ndiscovered and shut down. During this time, approximately 20 users\nsynchronized against the portage mirror stored on this box. The method used\nto gain access to the box remotely is still under investigation. We will\nrelease more details once we have ascertained the cause of the remote\nexploit.This box is not an official Gentoo infrastructure box and is instead donated\nby a sponsor. The box provides other services as well and the sponsor has\nrequested that we not publicly identify the box at this time. Because the\nGentoo part of this box appears to be unaffected by this exploit, we are\ncurrently honoring the sponsor's request. That said, if at any point, we\ndetermine that any file in the portage tree was modified in any way, we will\nrelease full details about the compromised server.",
  "impact": "There is no known impact at this time.",
  "workaround": "There is no known workaround at this time.",
  "resolution": "Again, based on the forensic analysis done so far, we are reasonably\nconfident that no files within the Portage tree on the box were affected.\nHowever, the server has been removed from all rsync.*.gentoo.org rotations\nand will remain so until the forensic analysis has been completed and the\nbox has been wiped and rebuilt. Thus, users preferring an extra level of\nsecurity may ensure that they have a correct and accurate portage tree by\nrunning:# emerge syncWhich will perform a sync against another server and ensure that all files\nare up to date.",

  "synopsis": "Postfix incorrectly checks the ownership of a mailbox, allowing, in certain\ncircumstances, to append data to arbitrary files on a local system with\nroot privileges.",
  "description": "Sebastian Krahmer of SuSE has found that Postfix allows to deliver mail\nto root-owned symlinks in an insecure manner under certain conditions.\nNormally, Postfix does not deliver mail to symlinks, except to\nroot-owned symlinks, for compatibility with the systems using symlinks\nin /dev like Solaris. Furthermore, some systems like Linux allow to\nhardlink a symlink, while the POSIX.1-2001 standard requires that the\nsymlink is followed. Depending on the write permissions and the\ndelivery agent being used, this can lead to an arbitrary local file\noverwriting vulnerability (CVE-2008-2936). Furthermore, the Postfix\ndelivery agent does not properly verify the ownership of a mailbox\nbefore delivering mail (CVE-2008-2937).",
  "impact": "The combination of these features allows a local attacker to hardlink a\nroot-owned symlink such that the newly created symlink would be\nroot-owned and would point to a regular file (or another symlink) that\nwould be written by the Postfix built-in local(8) or virtual(8)\ndelivery agents, regardless the ownership of the final destination\nregular file. Depending on the write permissions of the spool mail\ndirectory, the delivery style, and the existence of a root mailbox,\nthis could allow a local attacker to append a mail to an arbitrary file\nlike /etc/passwd in order to gain root privileges.The default configuration of Gentoo Linux does not permit any kind of\nuser privilege escalation.The second vulnerability (CVE-2008-2937) allows a local attacker,\nalready having write permissions to the mail spool directory which is\nnot the case on Gentoo by default, to create a previously nonexistent\nmailbox before Postfix creates it, allowing to read the mail of another\nuser on the system.",
  "workaround": "The following conditions should be met in order to be vulnerable to\nlocal privilege escalation.Consequently, each one of the following workarounds is efficient.Concerning the second vulnerability, check the write permissions of\n/var/spool/mail, or check that every Unix account already has a\nmailbox, by using Wietse Venema's Perl script available in the official\nadvisory.",

  "description": "Exploitation of a buffer overflow in The XFree86 Window System\ndiscovered by iDefence allows local attackers to gain root\nprivileges.The problem exists in the parsing of the 'font.alias' file. The X\nserver (running as root) fails to check the length of the user\nprovided input, so a malicious user may craft a malformed\n'font.alias' file causing a buffer overflow upon parsing,\neventually leading to the execution of arbitrary code.To reproduce the overflow on the command line one can run:# cat > fonts.dir <<EOF \n1\nword.bdf -misc-fixed-medium-r-semicondensed--13-120-75-75-c-60-iso8859-1\nEOF\n# perl -e 'print \"0\" x 1024 . \"A\" x 96 . \"\\n\"' > fonts.alias\n# X :0 -fp $PWD{Some output removed}...

  "description": "Several vulnerabilities were found in PHP. Mattias Bengtsson and Philip\nOlausson reported integer overflows in the gdImageCreate() and\ngdImageCreateTrueColor() functions of the GD library which can cause\nheap-based buffer overflows (CVE-2007-3996). Gerhard Wagner discovered\nan integer overflow in the chunk_split() function that can lead to a\nheap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2007-2872). Its incomplete fix caused\nincorrect buffer size calculation due to precision loss, also resulting\nin a possible heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2007-4661 and\nCVE-2007-4660). A buffer overflow in the sqlite_decode_binary() of the\nSQLite extension found by Stefan Esser that was addressed in PHP 5.2.1\nwas not fixed correctly (CVE-2007-1887).Stefan Esser discovered an error in the zend_alter_ini_entry() function\nhandling a memory_limit violation (CVE-2007-4659). Stefan Esser also\ndiscovered a flaw when handling interruptions with userspace error\nhandlers that can be exploited to read arbitrary heap memory\n(CVE-2007-1883). Disclosure of sensitive memory can also be triggered\ndue to insufficient boundary checks in the strspn() and strcspn()\nfunctions, an issue discovered by Mattias Bengtsson and Philip Olausson\n(CVE-2007-4657)Stefan Esser reported incorrect validation in the FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL\nfilter of the Filter extension allowing arbitrary email header\ninjection (CVE-2007-1900). NOTE: This CVE was referenced, but not fixed\nin GLSA 200705-19.Stanislav Malyshev found an error with unknown impact in the\nmoney_format() function when processing \"%i\" and \"%n\" tokens\n(CVE-2007-4658). zatanzlatan reported a buffer overflow in the\nphp_openssl_make_REQ() function with unknown impact when providing a\nmanipulated SSL configuration file (CVE-2007-4662). Possible memory\ncorruption when trying to read EXIF data in exif_read_data() and\nexif_thumbnail() occurred with unknown impact.Several vulnerabilities that allow bypassing of open_basedir and other\nrestrictions were reported, including the glob() function\n(CVE-2007-4663), the session_save_path(), ini_set(), and error_log()\nfunctions which can allow local command execution (CVE-2007-3378),\ninvolving the readfile() function (CVE-2007-3007), via the Session\nextension (CVE-2007-4652), via the MySQL extension (CVE-2007-3997) and\nin the dl() function which allows loading extensions outside of the\nspecified directory (CVE-2007-4825).Multiple Denial of Service vulnerabilities were discovered, including a\nlong \"library\" parameter in the dl() function (CVE-2007-4887), in\nseveral iconv and xmlrpc functions (CVE-2007-4840 and CVE-2007-4783),\nin the setlocale() function (CVE-2007-4784), in the glob() and\nfnmatch() function (CVE-2007-4782 and CVE-2007-3806), a floating point\nexception in the wordwrap() function (CVE-2007-3998), a stack\nexhaustion via deeply nested arrays (CVE-2007-4670), an infinite loop\ncaused by a specially crafted PNG image in the png_read_info() function\nof libpng (CVE-2007-2756) and several issues related to array\nconversion.",

Lockfiles created during normal Portage\noperation of portage could be manipulated by local users resulting in the\ntruncation of hard linked files; causing a Denial of Service attack on\nthe system.",
  "description": "A flaw in Portage's sandbox wrapper has been found where the temporary\nlockfiles are subject to a hard-link attack which allows linkable files to\nbe overwritten to an empty file. This can be used to damage critical files\non a system causing a Denial of Service, or alternatively this attack may\nbe used to cause other security risks; for example firewall configuration\ndata could be overwritten without notice.The vulnerable sandbox functions have been patched to test for these new\nconditions: namely; for the existance of a hard-link which would be removed\nbefore the sandbox process would continue, for the existance of a\nworld-writable lockfile in which case the sandbox would also remove it, and\nalso for any mismatches in the UID ( anything but root ) and the GID (\nanything but the group of the sandbox process ).If the vulnerable files cannot be removed by the sandbox, then the sandbox\nwould exit with a fatal error warning the adminstrator of the issue. The\npatched functions also fix any other sandbox I/O operations which do not\nexplicitly include the mentioned lockfile.",

  "description": "Mozilla developers fixed several bugs, including an issue with\nmodifying XPCNativeWrappers (CVE-2007-3738), a problem with event\nhandlers executing elements outside of the document (CVE-2007-3737),\nand a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CVE-2007-3736). They\nalso fixed a problem with promiscuous IFRAME access (CVE-2007-3089) and\nan XULRunner URL spoofing issue with the wyciwyg:// URI and HTTP 302\nredirects (CVE-2007-3656). Denials of Service involving corrupted\nmemory were fixed in the browser engine (CVE-2007-3734) and the\nJavaScript engine (CVE-2007-3735). Finally, another XSS vulnerability\ncaused by a regression in the CVE-2007-3089 patch was fixed\n(CVE-2007-3844).",
  "impact": "A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web\npage that will trigger one of the vulnerabilities, possibly leading to\nthe execution of arbitrary code or a Denial of Service. It is also\npossible for an attacker to perform cross-site scripting attacks, which\ncould result in the exposure of sensitive information such as login\ncredentials.",

  "description": "Hiredis is vulnerable to integer overflow if provided maliciously crafted or corrupted `RESP` `mult-bulk` protocol data. When parsing `multi-bulk` (array-like) replies, hiredis fails to check if `count * sizeof(redisReply*)` can be represented in `SIZE_MAX`. If it can not, and the `calloc()` call doesn't itself make this check, it would result in a short allocation and subsequent buffer overflow.",

A context sharing vulnerability in\nvserver-sources is also handled by this advisory as well as CAN-2004-0447,\nCAN-2004-0496 and CAN-2004-0565. Patched, or updated versions of these\nkernels have been released and details are included along with this\nadvisory.",
  "description": "The Linux kernel allows a local attacker to mount a remote file system\non a vulnerable Linux host and modify files' group IDs. On 2.4 series\nkernels this vulnerability only affects shared NFS file systems. This\nvulnerability has been assigned CAN-2004-0497 by the Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project.Also, a flaw in the handling of /proc attributes has been found in 2.6\nseries kernels; allowing the unauthorized modification of /proc\nentries, especially those which rely solely on file permissions for\nsecurity to vital kernel parameters.An issue specific to the VServer Linux sources has been found, by which\n/proc related changes in one virtual context are applied to other\ncontexts as well, including the host system.CAN-2004-0447 resolves a local DoS vulnerability on IA64 platforms\nwhich can cause unknown behaviour and CAN-2004-0565 resolves a floating\npoint information leak on IA64 platforms by which registers of other\nprocesses can be read by a local user.Finally, CAN-2004-0496 addresses some more unknown vulnerabilities in\n2.6 series Linux kernels older than 2.6.7 which were found by the\nSparse source code checking tool.",
  "impact": "Bad Group IDs can possibly cause a Denial of Service on parts of a host\nif the changed files normally require a special GID to properly\noperate. By exploiting this vulnerability, users in the original file\ngroup would also be blocked from accessing the changed files.The /proc attribute vulnerability allows local users with previously no\npermissions to certain /proc entries to exploit the vulnerability and\nthen gain read, write and execute access to entries.These new privileges can be used to cause unknown behaviour ranging\nfrom reduced system performance to a Denial of Service by manipulating\nvarious kernel options which are usually reserved for the superuser.\nThis flaw might also be used for opening restrictions set through /proc\nentries, allowing further attacks to take place through another\npossibly unexpected attack vector.The VServer issue can also be used to induce similar unexpected\nbehaviour to other VServer contexts, including the host. By successful\nexploitation, a Denial of Service for other contexts can be caused\nallowing only root to read certain /proc entries. Such a change would\nalso be replicated to other contexts, forbidding normal users on those\ncontexts to read /proc entries which could contain details needed by\ndaemons running as a non-root user, for example.Additionally, this vulnerability allows an attacker to read information\nfrom another context, possibly hosting a different server, gaining\ncritical information such as what processes are running. This may be\nused for furthering the exploitation of either context.CAN-2004-0447 and CAN-2004-0496 permit various local unknown Denial of\nService vulnerabilities with unknown impacts - these vulnerabilities\ncan be used to possibly elevate privileges or access reserved kernel\nmemory which can be used for further exploitation of the system.CAN-2004-0565 allows FPU register values of other processes to be read\nby a local user setting the MFH bit during a floating point operation -\nsince no check was in place to ensure that the FPH bit was owned by the\nrequesting process, but only an MFH bit check, an attacker can simply\nset the MFH bit and access FPU registers of processes running as other\nusers, possibly those running as root.",

All 2.6 users are affected\nby the /proc attribute issue and the only known workaround is to\ndisable /proc support. The VServer flaw applies only to\nvserver-sources, and no workaround is currently known for the issue.\nThere is no known fix to CAN-2004-0447, CAN-2004-0496 or CAN-2004-0565\nother than to upgrade the kernel to a patched version.As a result, all users affected by any of these vulnerabilities should\nupgrade their kernels to ensure the integrity of their systems.",

  "description": "The memory subsystem allows for shrinking, growing, and moving of\nchunks of memory along any of the allocated memory areas which the\nkernel posesses.To accomplish this, the do_mremap code calls the do_munmap() kernel\nfunction to remove any old memory mappings in the new location - but,\nthe code doesn't check the return value of the do_munmap() function\nwhich may fail if the maximum number of available virtual memory area\ndescriptors has been exceeded.Due to the missing return value check after trying to unmap the middle\nof the first memory area, the corresponding page table entries from the\nsecond new area are inserted into the page table locations described by\nthe first old one, thus they are subject to page protection flags of\nthe first area. As a result, arbitrary code can be executed.",
  "impact": "Arbitrary code with normal non-super-user privelerges may be able to\nexploit this vulnerability and may disrupt the operation of other parts\nof the kernel memory management subroutines finally leading to\nunexpected behavior.Since no special privileges are required to use the mremap() and\nmummap() system calls any process may misuse this unexpected behavior\nto disrupt the kernel memory management subsystem. Proper exploitation\nof this vulnerability may lead to local privilege escalation allowing\nfor the execution of arbitrary code with kernel level root access.Proof-of-concept exploit code has been created and successfully tested,\npermitting root escalation on vulnerable systems.
